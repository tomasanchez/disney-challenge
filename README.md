## Documentation

### Database Model

I decided to use an SQL database, The model was designed with `4` tables:

- Characters
- Appearances
- Genres
- Characters_Appearances

All autogenerated by `Spring JPA`.

This `Entity-Relationship Diagram` represents the persistence layer.

### Application Design
#### Entity Model

Used a `@MappedSuperClass` for convenience methods, and consistents Ids.
Designed `Appearance` as an abstract class with the `Inheritance Strategy type SingleTable` for extensibility, will be easy to add another `Appearance Type` such as `Comic` for example with different _business rules_.

There is a `@ManyToMany` relation ship between `FictionalCharacter` and `Appearance`, however as no additional data of this association needs to be stored, there is no need for modeling a class for a new association-entity.

`Appearance` has also a `@ManyToOne` relationship with `Genre`.
