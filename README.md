## Documentation

### Database Model

I decided to use an SQL database, The model was designed with `4` tables:

- Characters
- Appearances
- Genres
- Characters_Appearances

All autogenerated by `Spring JPA`.

This `Entity-Relationship Diagram` represents the persistence layer.

### Application Design
#### Entity Model

Used a `@MappedSuperClass` for convenience methods, and consistents Ids.
Designed `Appearance` as an abstract class with the `Inheritance Strategy type SingleTable` for extensibility, will be easy to add another `Appearance Type` such as `Comic` for example with different _business rules_.

There is a `@ManyToMany` relation ship between `FictionalCharacter` and `Appearance`, however as no additional data of this association needs to be stored, there is no need for modeling a class for a new association-entity.

`Appearance` has also a `@ManyToOne` relationship with `Genre`.

### Auth

Using `Spring Security`, in order to use a `Bearer Token` authentication, found the need to implement a custom `UserDetailsService` for the application's `DUser` 

![Auth Schema](./docs/assets/auth-schema.svg)

How it works

there are two different filters for `Authentication` and `Authorization`, in both cases the aforementioned `AuthenticationManager` is injected.

`TokenFilterAuthentication` retrieves the `DUser` from the `HttpServletRequest` and authenticates it. On successful authentication it adds a new generated token by the `TokenValidator` to the `HttpServletResponse`

`TokenAuthorizationFilter` retrieves a token from the request, and using `TokenValidator` validates it, when it can't authorize, sends an error response.
